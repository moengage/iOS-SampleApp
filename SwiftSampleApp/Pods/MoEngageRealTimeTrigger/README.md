MoEngage provides a platform which enables companies to deliver personalized interactions to their users through push notifications, in-app campaigns, email campaigns and other re-targeting channels.

## Integration

### Integration through CocoaPods
CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Objective C & Swift projects and makes integration easier.

1. If you don't have CocoaPods installed, you can do it by executing the following line in your terminal.

    ```sudo gem install cocoapods```
    
2. If you don't have a Podfile, create a plain text file named Podfile in the Xcode project directory with the following content, making sure to set the platform and version that matches your app.

    ```pod 'MoEngageRealTimeTrigger'```
    
3. Install MoEngageRealTimeTrigger SDK by executing the following in the Xcode project directory.

    ```pod install```
    
4. Now, open your project workspace and check if MoEngageRealTimeTrigger SDK is properly added.
    

Thats it!! SDK is successfully integrated in the project, and ready to use.
